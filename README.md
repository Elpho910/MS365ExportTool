# MS365ExportTool
Tool for stripping MS365 user export of all un-necessary data.

Load in an export from the users list in the MS365 admin centre.

Select which columns you would like to remove - By default everything is selected for removal except for - Display Name, First Name, Last Name, User Principal Name, and Licenses as these are the columns we found we needed to keep the majority of the time.

Built to automate the process of making user lists exported from MS365 admin panel more readable.
